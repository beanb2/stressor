Description: Traditional model evaluation metrics fail to capture model 
    performance under less than ideal conditions. This package employs 
    techniques to evaluate models "under-stress". This includes testing 
    models' extrapolation ability, or testing accuracy on specific 
    sub-samples of the overall model space. Included also are a series 
    of convienet visualizations of model accuracy under "stressful" conditions.
